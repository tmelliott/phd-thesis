\section{Estimates of arrival time}
\label{sec:eta_estimates}

As previously discussed, there is considerable uncertainty in the posterior predictive distribution of arrival time. This uncertainty makes point estimates challenging to provide since there is a strong negative correlation between \emph{accuracy}---how far the estimates are from the actual value---and \emph{reliability}---how \emph{useful} the estimate is. Take, for example, the median, which has, in theory, the best accuracy, but 50\% of the time the bus arrives earlier than it predicts, which could result in a passenger missing their bus were they to arrive at the predicted time. An alternative to point estimates that allows conveyance of uncertainty are \emph{prediction intervals}.

The method for obtaining estimates from the \glspl{cdf} from \cref{eq:pf_pdf_arrivaltime} uses quantiles, such that the $q$-quantile, $q\in(0,1)$, is found by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:eta_calc_quantile}
\hat\Teta_q = \max\left\{a \in \{0, 1, \ldots\} : \Pr{A < a} \geq q\right\}
\end{equation}
\Cref{fig:eta_calc_quantile} shows a single \gls{cdf} with a horizontal line at $q = 0.5$, where the solution to \cref{eq:eta_calc_quantile} is the maximum of the values below this line (the red points) which is, in this case, $\hat\Teta_{0.5} = 11$.
