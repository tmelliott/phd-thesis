\chapter{\Rt{} transit data}
\label{cha:data}



\AT{} operates a fleet of vehicles consisting of buses, trains, and ferries to transport passengers around Auckland, New Zealand's most populous urban region \citep{StatsNZ_2019}, from Wellsford in the north to Pukekohe in the south. Serving the region are 1040~routes\footnote{As of 12 August 2019, sourced from \url{https://at.govt.nz/}.}, each providing a service from an \emph{origin} to a \emph{destination} via a specified sequence of \emph{stops} at which passengers may board or alight.


For each route, one or more \emph{trips} are scheduled to operate, typically departing from the origin stop at a fixed time, with approximate arrival times for the intermediate stops along the way. In some cases, services wait at specific stops until the scheduled departure time, known as a \emph{layover}; in others, drivers may adjust their speed to adhere to the schedule. In most cases, however, drivers do not heed the schedule and drive along the route at whatever speed is reasonable\footnote{This is at least what I have observed over 10~years of catching public transport.}. Not all trips run every day; typically trips are scheduled as `weekday', `Saturday', or `Sunday and public holidays'. Altogether there are (at the time of writing) 24,919~trips provided by \AT{}, 14,022 of which run every weekday.


The assignment of routes, trips, and stops is a common occurrence in transport systems, to the extent that it was formalised by Google's \emph{\acrfull{gtfs}} \citep {GoogleDevelopers_2006}. \GTFS{} provides a detailed specification of how transit data should be organised, making it significantly easier for external systems to access, with the primary example being Google Maps. However, plenty of other applications exist that make use of it\footnote{Including the one we are presenting.}. \GTFS{} has now been adopted by 1,234~providers across 672~locations globally which are shown in \cref{fig:gtfs_feeds}. \Cref{sec:gtfs} provides further information on \gls{gtfs}.

The vehicles servicing the trips are observed as they travel along the route, either as intermittent \GPS{} locations (\emph{vehicle positions}), or on arrival at or departure from bus stops along the way (\emph{trip updates}). The structure of this data is specified by `GTFS-realtime',\footnote{\url{https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime}} and is described in detail in \cref{sec:realtime-data}, along with a discussion of the issues encountered using the \AT{} data.


One of the main ideas we discussed in \cref{sec:literature} was the importance of combining data from multiple routes when predicting arrival times. As it stands, there is no direct method for determining if two routes overlap---that is, share a common path---from \GTFS{} data. The most straightforward approach is to compare subsequences of stops, with routes servicing the same stops most likely following the same path between them. There are, however, several situations where this is not the case. We formalise this idea, as well as expand on it, in \cref{sec:route-segments}.


The real-time nature of the application demands that predictions are made as soon after observing the data as possible. For this reason, \glspl{rbm} are a logical choice for estimating states in real-time and have been used extensively in the literature. This family of models are commonly used in vehicle tracking applications \citep{Zhao_1997,Mutambara_2000,Carpenter_1999,Wall_1999}, allowing the vehicle's state (such as speed) to be estimated from a real-time sequence of noisy measurements of its location. The final section of this chapter provides an introduction to the \glspl{rbm} used throughout the remainder of this thesis.
