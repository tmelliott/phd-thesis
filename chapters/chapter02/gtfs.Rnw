\label{sec:gtfs}

The adoption of GTFS to public transport agencies around the world
has made it possible for apps such as Google Maps
to access and display public transport data to users,
regardless of their location.
The main goal of GTFS is to specify, in detail,
how transit data should be organised in a fundamental way
that is consistent between the \glspl{api} provided
by independent agencies.
There are several components of GTFS that are of particular interest to us:
routes, trips, stops, stop times, and shapes.
Extensive documentation can be found on these and the other components
on the GTFS website (\url{https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/}).

A \emph{route} is a collection of \emph{trips} that are displayed to comuters
as a single service;
a \emph{trip} is a a journey servicing two or more stops at a specific time;
\emph{stops} are locations where passengers are picked up or dropped off;
\emph{stop times} are the (scheduled) times at which vehicles
will arrive at stops for each trip;
and a \emph{shape} is the GPS track a vehicle will take for a specific route.
