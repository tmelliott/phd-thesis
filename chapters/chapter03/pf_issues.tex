\subsection{Real-time performance of the \pf{}}
\label{sec:pf_issues}



The two components of the model to assess are the iteration timings and the performance of the particle filter itself. That is, does the program run fast enough to be feasible in real-time, and is the model (and its \pf{} implementation) capable of modelling a transit vehicle in \rt{}?


\paragraph{Is the particle filter fast enough?}
At peak hour on a typical weekday morning, there can be in excess of 1000~buses operating in Auckland. This leads to having more than $1000\Np$~particles in memory, each being mutated and reweighted approximately once every 30~seconds or so. By varying $N$, we can control how quickly each set of observations is processed. \Cref{fig:pf_timings} shows the average timings of the vehicle model component of our application, as well as the average time per particle. More particles require more processing power, though there is additional overhead during the \emph{resampling} phase. Limiting the frequency of resampling is therefore necessary to make the program run faster. This is why we use the effective sample size, $\Neff$.

\paragraph{How does the model perform?}





To assess how well our model performs in \rt{}, we repeated the simulation with a range of values of system noise $\Vnoise$, GPS error $\GPSerr$, and number of particles $\Np$. For each simulation, we computed \emph{proportional effective sample size}, \emph{degeneration rate}, and \emph{relative variance}.

The \emph{proportional effective sample size} is simply a measure of the proportion of effective sample size, $\tilde\Neff = \frac{\Neff}{\Np}$. The higher this value, the less often the vehicle's state needs resampling, which decreases the average iteration time. \Cref{fig:model_performance_neff} shows the effect of $\Np$, system noise, and GPS error on $\tilde\Neff$. The most striking relationship is between $\tilde\Neff$ and GPS error: for larger error, more particles retain a high likelihood, and so the total weight is more evenly distributed. Conversely, larger values of system noise result in more variation between particles, which leads to fewer particles ending near the observation position.

\end{figure}

The \emph{degeneration rate} is the proportion of samples in which no particles end near the vehicle's reported position. In this case, all of the particle likelihoods tend to zero, so the weights become undefined. This results in needing to reinitialize the particle filter for that vehicle, leading to the loss of any information about vehicle speed along the most recently travelled road segment(s). We see from \cref{fig:model_performance_degen} that increasing GPS error or the number of particles reduces degeneration rate, while increasing system noise only slightly reduces degeneration. Larger GPS error means that particles do not need to end as close to the observed location to have a positive likelihood, while increasing $\Np$ means more chance for a particle to end near the true bus.

Finally, we have \emph{relative speed variance} along roads, which we use to compare the precision of the various models. It is based on the ratio of variance for a single simulation compared to over all simulations for each road segment. Let $\vec z_\ell^{e,s}$ be a vector of all vehicle speeds along road segment $\ell$ during the simulation with GPS error and system noise equal to $e$ and $s$, respectively. The ratio of the variance of speed for the single simulation compared to all simulations along one single road segment is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rel_speed_var_ratio}
v_\ell^{e,s} =
\frac{
    \mathrm{Var}(\vec z_\ell^{e,s})
}{
    \mathrm{Var}(\cup_e\cup_s \vec z_\ell^{e,s})
}
\end{equation}.
That is, for each segment in each simulation, we have a value representing whether this simulation estimates speed more or less accurately. We then compute the average ratio over all $L$ road segments,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rel_speed_var}
\bar v^{e,s} = \frac{1}{L} \sum_{l=1}^L v_\ell^{e,s}
\end{equation}
A small value of $\bar v^{e,s}$ tells us that, on average, the simulation with GPS error $e$ and system nosie $s$ estimates road speed \emph{with greater precision} than the other simulations. \Cref{fig:model_performance_var} presents these results, where we see the greatest effect on relative variance caused by increasing GPS error. Increasing $\Np$ produces a small decrease, and chances to system noise show no discernable effect.

The results displayed in \cref{fig:model_performance_neff,fig:model_performance_degen,fig:model_performance_var} present a \emph{trade-off} between the performance and estimation. Increasing GPS error increases the effective sample size, which reduces the frequency of resampling and thus speeding up each iteration. We also see a reduction in the rate of degeneration, which implies the particle filter is less likely to lose the vehicle and provide the desired speed estimates. However, increasing GPS error also increases the relative uncertainty of speed estimates. Increasing the number of particles generally results in a reduction in both degeneration rate and relative uncertainty, but, from \cref{fig:pf_timings}, this comes at the cost of increased computational demand.
