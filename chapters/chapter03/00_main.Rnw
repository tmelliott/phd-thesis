\label{cha:vehicle_model}

The \rt{} position data of vehicles is only a small piece
of the information required to model network travel times.
The main purpose of this section is to develop a model
that can interpolate the trajectory of a vehicle between observations,
thus providing estimates of the time taken to travel along road segments.
This needs to account for any intermediate bus stops and, ideally,
any intersections along the route.


In this chapter, we develop a model of the observed data $\Vobs$ for each vehicle,
using the GTFS network developed in section~\ref{sec:route-segments}.
We have chosen to implement it in \rt{} using a \pf{},
which allows much more flexibility in the model.
The design and implementation of the \pf{} is discussed later in
section~\ref{sec:particle-filter}
