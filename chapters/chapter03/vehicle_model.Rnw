\subsection{Real-time vehicle model}
\label{sec:vehicle_model}

The vehicle model itself implements a simplified estimation of bus behaviour,
allowing us to infer the vehicle's trajectory between consecutive observations.
The foundation of this model is a simple dynamic vehicle tracking model,
in which the vehicle's unknown state is infered
