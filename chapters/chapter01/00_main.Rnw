\chapter{Introduction}
\label{cha:intro}


Over the last three decades, technological advances have changed the way people use public transport.
No longer do commuters arrive at a bus stop, take a seat,
and wait as long as it takes for their bus to appear at the corner;
instead they can open an app on their phone and see, on a map,
just how far away their bus is.
Indeed, the question of \emph{how far away is my bus?}
has become one of \emph{how long until my bus arrives?},
which is difficult to judge solely from the bus' location.


So, just how is a position on a map turned into a
decreasing number that reaches zero just as the bus reaches the stop?
Usually, it's not.
Most public transport users are well aware of the inaccuracy of the current system,
with \glspl{eta} often reaching zero with no bus in sight.
Despite decades of research into predicting bus arrival (see section~\ref{sec:literature}),
the responsibility of arrival time prediction has moved from a probabilitic model
to a deterministic function based soley on observations and static schedule information.


To reliably predict a bus's arrival time,
we need to know two things:
\emph{where it is now}, and \emph{how long it will take to get here}.
As mentioned above, the first of these is readily available thanks to  GPS technology;
the latter is simply a function of tavel time,
which depends on traffic conditions: free-flowing, slow, or crawling?
Sadly, this is an unknown quantity;
while information of this type is available (for example in Google Maps),
it is not \emph{accessible} for use in any predictive context.
But surely there is a way.
Surely, with the amount of data available, there is a way of figuring out
just how congested the intermediate roads are,
and using this to improve the reliability of \glspl{eta}.


In this thesis, we present an approach to bus modelling that
uses one of the most widely available transit data formats
(GTFS, chapter~\ref{cha:data})
to not only track the real-time locations of vehicles
(chapter~\ref{cha:vehicle_model}),
but also to model the congestion along roads within the transport network
(chapter~\ref{cha:network_model}).
This allows traffic flow to be incorporated into arrival time predictions
(chapter~\ref{cha:prediction}),
providing commuters with a more reliable answer to their question,
\emph{just how long until my bus arrives?}
(chapter~\ref{cha:etas}).
