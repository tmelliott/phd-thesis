\chapter{Transit network}
\label{cha:network_model}

The collection of bus stops and intersections, and the roads which connect them, we refer to as a \emph{transit network}. The \emph{state} of this network changes in response to events throughout the city, some of which are predictable---peak traffic, for example---while others are not, such as accidents or weather events. In chapter 3, we measured this state by tracking individual vehicles as they moved through the network. Now we discuss the network state itself, how it changes over time, and how we use the speed observations to update its state. Finally, we discuss short-term forecasting as could be used for arrival time estimation in \cref{cha:prediction}.


Estimation of the network's state from vehicle travel time observations requires an understanding of the relationship between them. The underlying state of the network determines how fast (or slow) vehicles travel through it, which changes over time. Since speed is unlikely to be constant over segments, we use \emph{average speed} over the length of a segment, calculated using the length of the segment and how long vehicles take to travel along it,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ch4:average_speed_formula}
\text{average speed (m/s)} = \frac{
\text{segment length (m)}
}{
\text{travel time along segment (s)}
}.
\end{equation}
However, there are a variety of factors that may affect the average speed of individual buses, such as driver behaviour, cyclists sharing the road, variance between lanes, or pedestrians crossing the road, to name a few. Thus, even buses travelling along a road at the same time often have different (average) speeds, resulting in a \emph{distribution} of vehicle speeds, as demonstrated in the top half of \cref{fig:nw_model_hierarchy}. To further complicate matters, the observed average vehicle speeds are made with a level of uncertainty, which is depicted in the second half of \cref{fig:nw_model_hierarchy}.


Previous work has used \emph{travel time} to model the network state \citep{Yu_2011,Cats_2015,Gong_2013,Shalaby_2004,Reinhoudt_1997}, while others have used \emph{vehicle speed}, as I introduced above \citep{Ma_2019,Celan_2017,Celan_2018,Xinghao_2013}. We found that travel times tended to have long tails which the \kf{} was less capable of modelling, and required a lot of manual work determining the appropriate parameter values. Speed, however, is independent of road length, so most of the parameter values could take a single value across all segments.


In this section, we develop a model to estimate the distribution of vehicle speeds along roads throughout the transit network. As with the vehicle model, we must keep in mind the real-time nature of the application, so computational efficiency is an important consideration. In \Cref{sec:nw_realtime}, I describe the real-time implementation of the model, while \cref{sec:nw_par_est} considers the estimation of model parameters from historical data. The model's forecasting ability can also be improved with historical data, as we discuss in \cref{sec:nw_hist_model} and revisit in \cref{cha:prediction}. Finally, we examine the computational aspects of the model's real-time implementation and its feasibility in \cref{sec:nw_implementation}.
