\section{Constructing a transit network model}
\label{sec:nw_hist_prior}



The relationship between the underlying travel time 
and the value we estimate (back in chapter 3) involves two steps. 
First, we must describe the relationship between the underlying travel time 
and the \emph{actual}  time taken. 
Secondly, we define the relationship between \emph{actual} and \emph{observed} 
(or, more specifically, estimated) travel time. 
This type of model is often called a \emph{heirarchical Bayesian model}.


First, we present the relationship at a fixed time $t_c$. 
We define $\NWstate_{\ell c}$ to be the average travel time of vehicles 
along road segment $\ell$ at time $t_c$, 
and $\NWvar_{\ell c}^2$ as the associated variance (\emph{between} vehicles). 
Now, the time taken for vehicle $m$ to travel along 
road $\ell$ at time $t_c$ is $\Vtt_{\ell c}^m$ seconds---%
to avoid complications we define the time a vehicle travels along a road 
as the time that it reaches the end of the road. 
Assuming that vehicle travel times follow a normal distribution, 
we write this as 
\begin{equation*}
    \Vtt_{\ell c}^m \sim
        \Normal{\NWstate_{\ell c}}{\NWvar_{\ell c}^2}
\end{equation*}
Once the bus reaches the end of the road and reports its position to us, 
we estimate (see section 3.3) how long it took, 
which is a noisy ``measurement'' of the time it \emph{actually} took, 
which we assume has an error of $\Vtterr_{\ell c}^m$ seconds. 
Again, assuming the errors follow a normal distribution, 
we write the observation as 
\begin{equation*}
\Vttobs_{\ell c}^m \sim 
    \Normal{\Vtt_{\ell c}^m}{\Vtterr_{\ell c}^m^2}.
\end{equation*}

Secondly, we need to consider that travel time changes over time for various reasons. 
The obvious one is congestion at peak times 
when lots of people are commuting (many in cars) to or from work, 
but throughout the day there can be fluctuations in traffic flow 
due to intersections, incidents, weather, or countless other causes. 
To model this, we need to account for 
\emph{systematic, predictable changes}, that is, congestion at peak times, 
and \emph{random changes}, which accounts for everything else. 
The systematic part, or trend, can be described 
using a transition function (or matrix) $\NWtransfun_c$, 
which, given the state at time $t_{c-1}$ predicts the state at time $t_c$. 
As for the random fluctuations, these are encapsulated by the model parameter $\NWnoise$, 
which can be interpreted as \emph{the rate of change of travel time}. 
Together, again assuming that the state follows a normal distribution, 
then we write 
\begin{equation*}
    \NWstate_{\ell c} \sim 
        \Normal{\NWstate_{\ell c-1}}{\NWnoise^2}.
\end{equation*}

However, we can describe the model with more detail than this. 
Let us assume that the \emph{fastest possible travel time} along a road is denoted $\NWmaxtt_\ell$, 
which would be obtained by a vehicle travelling at the posted speed limit along the entire road. 
Now $\NWstate_{\ell c}$ is the additional travel time caused by congestion, 
driver behaviour, and so on, leading to 
\begin{equation*}
    \Vtt_{\ell c}^m \sim
        \Normal{\NWmaxtt_\ell + \NWstate_{\ell c}}{\NWvar_{\ell c}^2}
\end{equation*}
for individual vehicles.

Now that we have a model, we can take a look at some data. 
\Cref{fig:tt_figure} shows the travel times 
between two stops on Symonds Street in central Auckland. 
We know that the maximum speed limit along this road is 50~km/h,
which is approximately \Sexpr{ceiling(50*1000/60/60)}~m/s.
The distance between the two stops is 610~m,
so we know the minimum possible travel time is
$\lfloor\frac{610}{14}\rfloor = \Sexpr{floor(610/14)}$~seconds.

The first model we fit, N1, uses the transition function 
\begin{equation*}
\NWtransfun(\NWstate_{\ell c}) = \NWstate_{\ell c-1}. 
\end{equation*}
We're using JAGS \citep{JAGS} to fit the hierarchical model described above, 
using the following priors:

- MU_SPEED ~ UNIFORM(3, 30) - max speed between 30 and 100kmh
- 


\newpage
\subsubsection*{Old}
In order to improve short-term predictions for the \kf{},
and also longer-term forecasts for arrival time prediction
(\cref{cha:prediction}),
we need to be model patterns in travel times over time.
This is particularly obvious around peak times,
where there is a general trend of increased travel time
along roads,
particularly those city-bound in morning peak,
and out-bound in evening peak,
although many roads experience congestion during both peaks.


The aim of this section is to estimate $\NWhistmean{}{t}$ and $\NWhistvar{}{t}$.
The first step to doing this is estimating the traffic speed
$\NWstate_{\ell,0:C}$,
which we did in \cref{sec:nw_par_est}.
