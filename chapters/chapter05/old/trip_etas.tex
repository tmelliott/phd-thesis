\section{Estimating arrival time distribtions}
\label{sec:trip_etas}

Once the trip parameters have all been estimated,
the arrival time at stop $j$ of trip with state
$\Tripr = \tvec{\Vtime_k, \TripStop, \TripDep, \TripSeg, \SegProg}$,
being serviced by a vehicle last observed at time $\Vtime_k$,
can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:trip_eta}
\Tarr_j =
\Vtime_k +
\SegProg (\NWstate^\Tripr_c)_\TripSeg +
\sum_{\ell=\TripSeg+1}^{\TripSeg(j)-1}
    \left(\NWstate^\Tripr_c\right)_\ell +
\sum_{m=\TripStop + \TripDep}^{j-1} \Tdwell_m
\end{equation}
which, broken down,
is the time the vehicle was last seen,
the travel time remaining on the current segment,
plus the travel time alone all segments from
the next segment up until the segment before the stop,
and finally the dwell time at all intermediate stops,
including the current stop if the vehicle has not yet
departed that stop.
