\section{ETA results}
\label{sec:trip_results}

The arrival time estimation methods described in
\cref{sec:trip_etas}
were implemented to compare both the
\emph{reliability} of results,
as well as the computation time.


The reliability of the results pertains to
the proportion of \gls{eta} credible intervals (80%, 95%, 99%)
that contain the ``true'' (as reported by the \gls{gtfs} feed)
arrival time at the stop.
