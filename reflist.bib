  abstract  = {The Kalman filter provides an effective solution to the linear Gaussian filtering problem. However where there is nonlinearity, either in the model specification or the observation process, other methods are required. Methods known generically as 'particle filters' are considered. These include the condensation algorithm and the Bayesian bootstrap or sampling importance resampling (SIR) filter. These filters represent the posterior distribution of the state variables by a system of particles which evolves and adapts recursively as new information becomes available. In practice, large numbers of particles may be required to provide adequate approximations and for certain applications, after a sequence of updates, the particle system will often collapse to a single point. A method of monitoring the efficiency of these filters is introduced which provides a simple quantitative assessment of sample impoverishment and the authors show how to construct improved particle filters that are both structurally efficient in terms of preventing the collapse of the particle system and computationally efficient in their implementation. This is illustrated with the classic bearings-only tracking problem.},

The system calculates arrival time estimations which inform both the customers and the operators of the company about the running of their buses. The calculations should be as accurate as possible in the interest of customer satisfaction. This paper shows that the use of a dynamic Kalman filter instead of a previously used static averaging algorithm, improves the error distribution up to 7% and often reduces maximum absolute error figures significantly. This technique may also prove to be a useful tool for other predicting systems.},

  Abstract = {In the past few years, technological changes have made it possible for bus passengers to learn about the expected arrival time when waiting for buses or even before arrival at the stop. In London, live bus arrival information is provided by Countdown signs at over 2500 bus stops. The bus arrival information is also available through Smartphone or tablet apps, the internet and SMS. Though these services are widely used, their impacts on passengers' perceived waiting time and passengers' behaviour remain unclear. The objective of this study is to assess how having real-time bus arrival information impacts on both passenger behaviour and how they value their waiting time at the bus stop. To address these research questions, this study is based on a survey containing a stated preference discrete choice experiment, which is supplemented with some qualitative research questions. 1690 completed interviews were achieved. Respondents were either recruited from bus users at bus stops who were invited to participate in an online or telephone survey, or from bus users supplied by TfL from their Oyster user database who were directed to the online survey. Discrete choice models were estimated and the resulting model coefficients quantify how different forms of real-time information impact on respondents' value of bus waiting time and how the values varied by different sub-groups of population. This study provides up-to-date, London-specific waiting time relative values (multiplier to the in-vehicle time) and provides critical implications in current appraisal of schemes on public transport services investment.},

Similar to kernel-based estimation, the proposed approach uses bandwidth to control the density smoothness, but each density estimate for a fixed bandwidth is determined by non-parametric likelihood maximization, with bandwidth selection carried out as model selection. This leads to simple models, yet with higher accuracy, especially in terms of the Kullback–Leibler or the Hellinger risk. The particular problem of estimating a symmetric density function is investigated. Both simulation study and real-world data examples suggest that the mixture-based estimators outperform their kernel-based counterparts. },

This paper proposed a new prediction model based on support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN) to predict bus arrival time at an objective stop with multi-routes. The preceding bus arrival time of objective route and all other routes passing the same stop, and travel speed of the target one are three inputs of the model. A case study was conducted with data collected in all workdays in October, 2014 in Zigong, Sichuan, China. The results of the proposed model indicate that both SVM and ANN models have high accuracy, while the ANN model is better than SVM model comparatively. The mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of prediction are less than 10% in most cases. By contrast, two groups with inputs changed or removed are set up to demonstrate the suitability of three inputs. No matter which method to use, SVM or ANN, the consequence of the proposed model is better than comparative groups.},

  abstract = {Journey planning is a key process in public transport, where travelers get informed how to make the best use of a given public transport system for their individual travel needs. A common trait of most available journey planners is that they assume deterministic travel times, but vehicles in public transport often deviate from their schedule. The present paper investigates the problem of finding journey plans in a stochastic environment. To fully exploit the flexibility inherent in multi-service public transport systems, we propose to use the concept of a routing policy instead of a linear journey plan. A policy is a state-dependent routing advice which specifies a set of services at each location from which the traveler is recommended to take the one that arrives first. We consider current time dependent policies, that is, when the routing advice at a given location is based solely on the current time. We propose two heuristic solutions that find routing policies that perform better than deterministic journey plans. A numerical comparison shows the achievable gains when applying the different heuristic policies based on extensive simulations on the public transport network of Budapest. The results show that the probability of arriving on time to a given destination can be significantly improved by following a policy instead of a linear travel plan.},

  abstract = {We introduce a journey planning problem in multi-modal transportation networks under uncertainty. The goal is to find a journey, possibly involving transfers between different transport services, from a given origin to a given destination within a specified time horizon. Due to uncertainty in travel times, the arrival times of transport services at public transport stops are modeled as random variables. If a transfer between two services is rendered unsuccessful, the commuter has to reconsider the remaining path to the destination. The problem is modeled as a Markov decision process in which states are defined as paths in the transport network. The main contribution is a backward induction method that generates an optimal policy for traversing the public transport network in terms of maximizing the probability of reaching the destination in time. By assuming history independence and independence of successful transfers between services we obtain approximate methods for the same problem. Analysis and numerical experiments suggest that while solving the path dependent model requires the enumeration of all paths from the origin to the destination, the proposed approximations may be useful for practical purposes due to their computational simplicity. In addition to on-time arrival probability, we show how travel and overdue costs can be taken into account, making the model applicable to freight transportation problems.},

  abstract = {This paper describes journey-planning procedures designed for use in a traveller information system covering fixed-schedule and demand-responsive public transport modes. The task is to construct a sequence of journey-legs to meet a traveller’s requirements with the least possible generalised cost, subject to time-window and other constraints. A journey may be carried out in a single leg by walking or by taking a taxi all the way from the origin to the destination, or by a sequence of one or more legs carried by public transport services sandwiched between walked segments connecting an initial pickup and final setdown stop. The public transport services may include fixed-route modes such as bus and train, and demand-responsive services running between fixed points. The main planning procedures are a high-level request-broker and a branch and bound procedure to handle multi-legged journeys; the request-broker also invokes a fleet-scheduling module to obtain bookings on demand-responsive services. The paper describes planning conditions, the planning procedures, and reduction techniques that are used to obtain acceptable computational performance. Tests with simulated demand suggest that the procedures are well suited for use in a real-time traveller information system.},

To provide accurate prediction of bus arrival at the bus stop the information of current position of the bus and bus travel time to the target stop are required. This paper investigates the bus velocity during different time periods and the impact of the bus network data model on the real-time prediction of arrival times at bus stops. The proposed model classifies bus travel times into time periods with respect to the historical data and the data model of the bus network. Discussion of four types of data model is presented, such as: a data model defined by bus stops and junctions of the roads, a data model defined only by bus stops, a data model which addresses the individual parts of the network in relation to the potential barriers that affect the travel speed of buses, and a data model with fixed-length links of the bus network. The analysis is performed in two different environments, the city of Ljubljana and the city of Maribor. The travel times are classified according to the average travel speed into four time periods: morning, afternoon, weekend and off-peak periods. Simulations showed that both the data model of the bus network and classifying runs into time periods affect the accuracy of predictions of bus arrival times at bus stops.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of travel time prediction of bus journeys which consist of bus riding times (may involve multiple bus services) and also the waiting times at transfer points. We propose a novel method called Traffic Pattern centric Segment Coalescing Framework (TP-SCF) that relies on learned disparate patterns of traffic conditions across different bus line segments for bus journey travel time prediction. Specifically, the proposed method consists of a training and a prediction stage. In the training stage, the bus lines are partitioned into bus line segments and the common travel time patterns of segments from different bus lines are explored using Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF). Bus line segments with similar patterns are classified into the same cluster. The clusters are then coalesced in order to extract data records for model training and bus journey time prediction. A separate Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) based model is trained for each cluster to predict the bus travel time under various traffic conditions. During prediction, a given bus journey is partitioned into the riding time components and waiting time components. The riding time components are predicted using the corresponding LSTM models of the clusters while the waiting time components are estimated based on historical bus arrival time records. We evaluated our method on large scale real-world bus travel data involving 30 bus services, and the results show that the proposed method notably outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for all the scenarios considered.},

  abstract = {An important aspect of Intelligent Public Transportation Systems (IPTS) is providing accurate travel time information. Knowing arrival times of public vehicles in advance can reduce waiting times of passengers and attract more people to take public transport. Existing approaches have two main limitations in the field of bus travel time prediction. First, influenced by increasingly complex real-time traffic factors and sparsity of real-time data, bus travel times can be difficult to predict accurately in modern cities. Second, bus dwelling and transit times are predominantly affected by different factors and hence have different patterns, but little research focuses on how to divide dwelling and transit areas and to build independent models for them. Consequently, we propose a novel segment-based approach to predict bus travel times using a combination of real-time taxi and bus datasets, that can automatically divide bus routes into dwelling and transit segments. Two models are built to predict them separately by incorporating different impact traffic factors. We evaluate our approach using real-world trajectory datasets, collected in Xi’an, China during June 2017. Compared to existing methods, the experimental results reveal that our approach improves the accuracy of bus travel time prediction, especially under abnormal traffic conditions.},

  abstract = {Analysing the accessibility disparity between different travel modes is recognised as an efficient way to assess the environmental and social sustainability of transport and land use arrangements. Travel times by different travel modes form an essential part of such an analysis. This paper aims to assess the comparability of different methods for calculating travel time by different travel modes. First, we briefly review the methods used in previous studies and identify different typical approaches, which we then compare. We use three computational models respectively for car and public transport (PT), implemented in our case study area, the capital region of Finland. In the car models, (1) the simple model ignores congestion and parking in travel time calculation; (2) the intermediate car model accounts for congestion but ignores parking; and (3) the more advanced car model takes into account all parts of the journey, including congestion and parking. For PT, (1) the simple model accounts for transit routes but ignores schedules; (2) the intermediate model incorporates schedule data in a simplistic way; and (3) the more advanced model adopts a door-to-door approach where true schedules (incl. congestion) and realistic route combinations are accounted for. Our results show that absolute differences in car and PT travel times are notable in the Greater Helsinki area, no matter which models are used for comparison. Modal travel time disparity appears smallest in the city centre area. We conclude that using conceptually corresponding models for car and PT travel time calculations is the key to achieving a reliable analysis of modal accessibility disparity. A door-to-door approach in travel time calculations (adopted in the most advanced models) also makes the results truly comparable in absolute terms. Finally, the more advanced the applied methods are, the more data hungry the analysis is. Here, recent developments in open data policies among urban transport data producers become very helpful.},

  abstract = { In many Chinese cities, traffic streams near bus stops differ from those of bus stops in developed countries. There are usually two lanes at a Chinese curbside stop: a nonmotorized lane and a motorized lane. Bus stops are often located on the nonmotorized lane. When a bus dwells at a curbside stop, nonmotorized vehicles, mainly bicycles, will move to the motorized lane. Thus, the presence of a stopped bus creates a temporary conflict between bicycles and cars, reducing road capacity. A road capacity model based on gap acceptance theory and queuing theory is presented for mixed traffic flow at the curbside stop. Traffic conditions are classified into two types: no stopped bus and presence of stopped bus at the curbside stop. The probabilities of no bus and presence of bus at a stop can be obtained by using the queuing model of bus streams. Under the former condition, the bicycle stream and the car stream have no conflict, and car capacity is not affected by the bicycle stream. Under the latter condition, the conflict between bicycles and cars on the motorized lane leads to an effect on car capacity by the bicycle stream. The effect on car capacity can be derived through gap acceptance theory. Car capacity at the curbside stop is a function of three types of traffic stream–-buses, cars, and bicycles–-and it may be applicable in traffic analysis and the design of bus stops in other developing Asian cities. },

Firstly, this paper points out that the bus dwell time at a bus bay possessed a high degree of uncertainty originating from the merging behaviour of bus to the vehicles in the shoulder lane. Secondly, it develops a novel probabilistic methodology to estimate the bus dwell time, including a standard regenerative stochastic process to model the interactions among buses, arrival passengers, and traffic on the shoulder lane. A tangible procedure is also proposed to estimate the mean and variable of the random bus dwell time. A case study is carried out to show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
