  abstract =      {The Kalman filter provides an effective solution to
                   the linear Gaussian filtering problem. However where
                   there is nonlinearity, either in the model
                   specification or the observation process, other
                   methods are required. Methods known generically as
                   'particle filters' are considered. These include the
                   condensation algorithm and the Bayesian bootstrap or
                   sampling importance resampling (SIR) filter. These
                   filters represent the posterior distribution of the
                   state variables by a system of particles which
                   evolves and adapts recursively as new information
                   becomes available. In practice, large numbers of
                   particles may be required to provide adequate
                   approximations and for certain applications, after a
                   sequence of updates, the particle system will often
                   collapse to a single point. A method of monitoring
                   the efficiency of these filters is introduced which
                   provides a simple quantitative assessment of sample
                   impoverishment and the authors show how to construct
                   improved particle filters that are both structurally
                   efficient in terms of preventing the collapse of the
                   particle system and computationally efficient in
                   their implementation. This is illustrated with the
                   classic bearings-only tracking problem.},

                   public transport, London Transport Buses (LTB)
                   equipped bus routes in a test area in North London
                   with a new system called Countdown. The system
                   calculates arrival time estimations which inform both
                   the customers and the operators of the company about
                   the running of their buses. The calculations should
                   be as accurate as possible in the interest of
                   customer satisfaction. This paper shows that the use
                   of a dynamic Kalman filter instead of a previously
                   used static averaging algorithm, improves the error
                   distribution up to 7% and often reduces maximum
                   absolute error figures significantly. This technique
                   may also prove to be a useful tool for other
                   predicting systems.},

  abstract =      {{An algorithm is presented for finding a zero of a
                   function which changes sign in a given interval. The
                   algorithm combines linear interpolation and inverse
                   quadratic interpolation with bisection. Convergence
                   is usually superlinear, and is never much slower than
                   for bisection. ALGOL 60 procedures are given.}},
