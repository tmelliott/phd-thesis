These last five years would not have been possible without the help of many. To all who have helped in any way, you have my gratitude.

First off, I thank my supervisor, Thomas Lumley, for proposing the entire context of this thesis, and for five years of being available (most of the time; there were one or two overseas conferences) for my usually unannounced drop-ins. I also thank Brendon Brewer, my co-supervisor, for early help getting started with \Cpp{}, and for offering his assistance should ever I need it.


To the entire statistics department at the University of Auckland: thank you for being so welcoming and supportive for the past five years (and more), in particular to Chris Wild for your incredible support of both my current work and future career opportunities. Thank you to the university itself for allowing me to pursue doctoral study and providing the much needed financial support of the Doctoral Scholarship, and to the Center for e-Research for supplying the necessary computing resources for my research.

To my friends both within and without the department, thank you for providing humour, social escapes, and those essential reminders that ``we all feel the same way, it's normal!''. And the wine. Thank you for the wine.

To my delightful partner Mark: thank you for supporting a broke student as he frantically condenses 4~years' work into 200~pages, for your emotional support over recent months, and the occasional nudge to get things done.

And lastly, to the most loving and supportive parents. These past two years have been amongst some of the hardest. Yet you were there for me, as always, whenever I needed a ride home, a roof over my head, or a home-cooked meal. My success is a testament to you both. Thank you.
