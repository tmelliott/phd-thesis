The real-time prediction of bus arrival time has been a central focus of \gls{rti} research over the past few decades. Much of this research has shown that the most important predictors are travel time between and dwell time at bus stops. Despite this, \glspl{eta} available in Auckland, New Zealand, make no account of real-time traffic state information. As road networks are dynamic and congestion can chance quickly, we present a generalised prediction procedure that uses buses to estimate traffic conditions, which are in turn used in the prediction of arrival times for all other buses travelling along the same roads, irrespective of the route they are servicing. We use a road network constructed from GTFS data, and estimate vehicle speeds as they travel around the network using a particle filter to estimate vehicle states. These speed estimates are passed to a Kalman filter to estimate road network state, which allows arrival time estimates to account for real-time traffic conditions. We use a simplified, discrete arrival time \gls{cdf} to make point and interval estimates, as well as estimate the probabilities of events for use in journey planning. Throughout, we concern ourselves with the real-time feasibility of our application and show that our method, despite being computationally complex, can provide arrival time estimates for all vehicles within the network within 10~seconds, on average.
