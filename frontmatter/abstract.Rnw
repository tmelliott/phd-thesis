The real-time prediction of bus arrival time has been a central focus of \gls{rti} research over the past few decades. Much of this research has shown that the most important predictors are travel time between and dwell time at bus stops. Despite this, \glspl{eta} available in Auckland, New Zealand, make no account of real-time traffic state information. As road networks are dynamic and congestion can chance quickly, we present a generalised prediction procedure that uses buses to estimate traffic conditions, which are in turn used in the prediction of arrival times for all other buses travelling along the same roads, irrespective of the route they are servicing. We construct a road network from data in the \gls{gtfs} format, allowing us to estimate real-time traffic conditions along physical roads. We use a particle filter to estimate vehicle states and road speeds, and a Kalman filter to update the road network state, which, combined, allow us to predict arrival times that account for real-time traffic conditions. We use a simplified, discrete arrival time \gls{cdf} to make point and interval estimates, as well as estimate the probabilities of events for use in journey planning. Throughout, we assess the real-time feasibility of the application and show that our method, despite being computationally complex, can provide arrival time estimates for all active vehicles within 10~seconds, on average.
